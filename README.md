# Task 01 - Caesar Cipher Tool 🔐

This project is part of the SkillCraft Technology Cyber Security Internship.

It is a basic implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool using Python. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.


## 💻 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py


✍️ What It Does
Prompts the user to choose between encryption or decryption

- Takes a message and a shift value as input

- Applies Caesar Cipher logic to transform the message

- Displays the encrypted or decrypted result


📌 Example
=== Caesar Cipher Tool ===
Type 'e' to encrypt or 'd' to decrypt: e
Enter your message: hello
Enter shift value (e.g., 3): 3
Encrypted message: khoor
