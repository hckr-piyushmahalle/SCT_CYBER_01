# Task 01 - Caesar Cipher Tool 🔐

This is an enhanced implementation of the classic **Caesar Cipher** as part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages with additional useful features.


## 💡 What's New in This Version

✅ Preserves uppercase & lowercase letters  
✅ Ignores non-alphabet characters (e.g., numbers, symbols, spaces)  
✅ Brute-force decryption mode (shows all 25 possible shifts)  
✅ Menu-driven UI for easy navigation


## 💻 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Open terminal in the project folder
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py



📋 Features
Encrypt Message: Shifts letters by a given number while keeping other characters intact

Decrypt Message: Reverses the shift to reveal the original text

Brute-force Decrypt: Displays all possible results to help decode unknown messages

Interactive Menu: Clean user interface in the terminal



🧪 Example
=== Caesar Cipher Tool ===
1. Encrypt a message
2. Decrypt a message
3. Brute-force decrypt
4. Exit

Enter your choice (1-4): 1
Enter your message: Hello, World!
Enter shift value (0-25): 3

🔐 Encrypted message: Khoor, Zruog!
